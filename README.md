### Objective
Use optical absorbance spectra for urea in solvent (water, saline, fresh dialysate) to predict urea concentration.

### Methods
1. Collect optical absorbance data with UV-Vis spectrophotometer for various urea concentrations in various solvents (water, 0.15M NaCl saline, fresh dialysate)
2. Observe various multivariate analysis and classifier algorithms on their accuracy of prediction.
